## Part 1 - Ethics
**Statement:**
I have completed the low-risk checklist and signed the ethical compliance statement. All participants were 16 years or older and provided signed consent forms before participating. Data collected are anonymized using participant IDs (e.g., P1, P2) instead of real names. Data are stored securely and submitted only to the teaching team; no generative AI tools were used to process participant data.

**Appendices included:**
- Low risk checklist(see Appendix 4)
- Ethical compliance statement (signed) (see Appendix 5)
- Information sheet (see Appendix 6)

## Part 2 - Usability evaluation plan

### 2.1 Goal
Evaluate the learnability and efficiency of the core functions of Sketchpad, focus on:
- Basic drawing tools(brush,shapes,text)
- Document operation(create,save,export)

### 2.2 Questions
- Can a new user finish basic drawing tasks in 3 minutes independently
- Can user find the function of export at the first time
- Whether the tool layout conforms to the user's intuition

### 2.3 Equipment/Materials/Environment
- Equipment
  1. Laptop(Install OBS Studio for screen recording and audio recording)
  2. Mobile timer
- Materials
  1. Online Task Card (Appendix 1)
  2. Online SUS Questionnaire (Appendix 2)
- Environment(Quiet and undisturbed)
  1. Library
  2. Study room

### 2.4 Participants
- Ideal customer:Students aged 16 to 25 with experience in digital painting
- Reason:Sketchpad is positioned as an educational tool, with students as its core user group

### 2.5 Tasks
- Task instruction card(for participants)(see Appendix 1)
  1. Darw a smiley face using "brush" tool.
  2. Insert the text "Hello World" and set the font size to 20.
  3. Save the work
  4. Export the work as a PNG format to the desktop.
  > *Do not use the help documentation or ask the tester.*

### 2.6 Test Procedure
| step | operation | time |  
|------|------|------|  
| 1 | Participants read the information sheet and sign the consent form | - |  
| 2 | Explain the task rules and start screen recording | Start |  
| 3 | Distribute task cards and participants carry out tasks | Record the task time |  
| 4 | Complete the SUS questionnaire and a brief interview | End |  
| 5 | Coffee vouchers will be given to thank the participants | - |

### 2.7 Data Collection
| data type | collection methods | content |  
|----------|----------|------|  
| behavioral data | screen capture | Operation path, number of errors |  
| feedback | SUS questionnaire | 10 scoring questions (see Appendix 2) |  
| Qualitative data | Interview recording | 5 questions (see Appendix 3) |

### 2.8 Data Analysis
- **Quantitative data**：Calculate the average time to complete tasks and SUS score '(total score -10)*2.5'  
- **Qualitative data**：Transcribe interview recordings → Extract high-frequency keywords (e.g., "difficult to find the export location")  
- **Triangulation verification**：Cross-analyze behavioral data + questionnaire + interviews, and answer research questions

---

## Part 3 - Pilot Study 

**Participants:**
- 3 students,age 20-22, minimal prior experience
- Chosen for convenience and relevance to target user

**Process Summary:**
- Each participant completed all tasks with screen recording
- SUS questionnaire administered after tasks
- Short interview conducted after questionnaire

**Results & Problems:**
- Task 1 initially unclear -> clarified in task instructions  
- Export function found slightly difficult → added SUS question about ease of export  
- Average completion time: ≈5 minutes

**Planned Changes:**  
- Simplify task instructions  
- Add specific guidance for saving/exporting drawings

## Part 4 – Heuristic Evaluation (6 marks)

Evaluate Sketchpad using Nielsen's 10 heuristics:

1. **Visibility of system status:**  
   - Status shown when saving/exporting.  
   - Improvement: Add progress indicator for large files.  

2. **Match between system and real world:**  
   - Terms like "brush" and "text" match real-world drawing.  

3. **User control and freedom:**  
   - Undo/redo available.  
   - Suggest: Add explicit cancel button for new drawings.  

4. **Consistency and standards:**  
   - Icons and menus consistent.  

5. **Error prevention:**  
   - Minimal prompts for accidental actions.  
   - Suggest: Confirm before deleting drawings.  

6. **Recognition rather than recall:**  
   - Tools visible on toolbar; easy to find.  

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use:**  
   - Keyboard shortcuts available.  

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design:**  
   - Interface clean and uncluttered.  

9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:**  
   - Error messages clear but could include suggested actions.  

10. **Help and documentation:**  
    - No integrated help; suggest adding short tutorial or tips.

**Appendix 6:** Information Sheet<br/> 
Usability Evaluation of Sketchpad Website<br/> 
 
INFORMATION SHEET  <br/> 
  


My name is {Mingyue Fei}, I’m a student part of the User Experience Design course at Massey (158359). As part of this course I am working on an assignment evaluating the usability of the Sketchpad website.  
 
The purpose of this assignment is for me to learn how to plan and run usability studies. I will be asking you to complete some tasks using the system. I will observe how people perform tasks using this system, and collect data to help me measure how usable this system is, such as time, questionnaires, screen/video/audio recording.  All information collected will be non-identifying. I will use my findings to write my assignment report. The session will take no longer than an hour.
 
You are invited to participate in my project, and I would appreciate any assistance you can offer me, although you are under no obligation to do so.  
 
If you don’t want to participate, you don’t have to give any reason for your decision. If you do participate, you may withdraw at any time during the session and you can also ask for any identifiable information you have provided to be withdrawn at any time until one week after the conclusion of your session, without explanation and without penalty, by contacting me (details below). If you are a student at Massey University choosing not to participate, or to withdraw yourself or your information, your grades or academic relationships with the University or members of staff will not be affected.    
  
All the information you provide will remain anonymous. You may decline to answer any particular question. The data collected during this study will be used for my assignment work only. Data will be shared with teaching staff for my course, they will delete it after marking. I will store the data securely and delete/dispose of it when it is no longer of use to my learning. You may ask any questions about the study at any time during participation. Your name will not be used in any reports arising from this study. At the conclusion of the study, a summary of the findings will be available upon request.  
 
If you agree to participate in this study, please first complete the consent form attached to this information sheet. Your consent form will be kept separately from your data so that no-one will be able to identify your answers from the information you provide.  
 
Thank you very much for your time and help in making this study possible. If you have any questions at any time you can email me at {3129207835@qq.com}, or my lecturer Rachel Blagojevic at r.v.blagojevic@massey.ac.nz

This project has been evaluated by peer review and judged to be low risk. Consequently, it has not been reviewed by one of the University’s Human Ethics Committees. The researcher(s) named above are responsible for the ethical conduct of this research.
