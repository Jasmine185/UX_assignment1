## 2. Usability evaluation plan
### 2.1 Goal
Evaluate the learnability and efficiency of the core functions of Sketchpad, focus on:
- Basic drawing tools(pens,shapes,text)
- Document operation(create,save,export)
### 2.2 Questions
- Can a new user finish basic drawing tasks in 3 minutes independently
- Can user find the function of export at the first time
- Whether the tool layout conforms to the user's intuition
### 2.3 Equipment/Materials/Environment
- Equipment
  1. Laptop(Install OBS Studio for screen recording and audio recording)
  2. Mobile timer
- Materials
  1. Paper Task Card (Appendix 1)
  2. Paper SUS Questionnaire (Appendix 2)
- Environment(Quiet and undisturbed)
  1. Library
  2. Study room
### 2.4 Participants
- Ideal customer:Students aged 16 to 25 with experience in digital painting
- Reason:Sketchpad is positioned as an educational tool, with students as its core user group
### 2.5 Tasks
- Task instruction card(for participants)
  1. Darw a smile face using "brush"
  2. Insert the text "Hello World" and adjust the font size to 20
  3. Export the work as a PNG format to the desktop
  > *Do not use the help documentation or ask the tester.*
### 2.6 Test Procedure
| step | operation | time |  
|------|------|------|  
| 1 | Participants read the information sheet and sign the consent form | - |  
| 2 | Explain the task rules and start screen recording | Start |  
| 3 | Distribute task cards and participants carry out tasks | Record the task time |  
| 4 | Complete the SUS questionnaire and a brief interview | End |  
| 5 | Coffee vouchers will be given to thank the participants | - |
### 2.7 Data Collection
| data type | collection methods | content |  
|----------|----------|------|  
| behavioral data | screen capture | Operation path, number of errors |  
| feedback | SUS questionare | 10 scoring questions (Appendix 2) |  
| Qualitative data | Interview recording | "Which feature do you most want to improve?" |
### 2.8 Data Analysis
- **Quantitative data**：Calculate the average time to complete tasks and SUS score (formula: (total score -10)*2.5)  
- **Qualitative data**：Transcribe interview recordings → Extract high-frequency keywords (such as "difficult to find the export location")  
- **Triangulation verification**：Cross-analyze behavioral data + questionnaires + interviews, and answer research questions
